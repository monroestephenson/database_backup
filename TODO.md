Most Critical (Blocking Basic Usage)
Database Support
MongoDB implementation is missing (other DBs appear to be implemented)
Need to complete database implementations in src/db/ directory
This is critical as it's a core functionality
Storage Backend Implementation
Local storage implementation is incomplete
Cloud storage (S3, Google Cloud) support is missing
The storage.hpp shows only basic interface
This is critical as users need somewhere to store their backups
Compression Functionality
Based on the TODO list and files, compression is not yet implemented
This is important for practical backup sizes
Need to implement compression.cpp functionality with zlib integration
Basic Testing Coverage
While there are test files, many core components lack tests
Need database connection tests
Need storage backend tests
Need compression tests
This is critical for reliability
Important but Not Blocking
Backup Verification
No implementation for verifying backup integrity
Important for reliability but not blocking initial usage
Documentation
User guide and configuration guide are missing
Important for adoption but not blocking functionality
Notification System
Basic implementation exists but needs enhancement
Email notifications not implemented
Not critical for core functionality
